This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript where null or undefined values are not properly handled as function parameters. The `bug.js` file showcases the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.  The solution explicitly checks for null or undefined values before proceeding with the function's logic, thereby preventing unexpected errors. This is crucial for writing robust and reliable JavaScript code.
